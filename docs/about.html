I'm Cyrus, also known as hecate946. I'm a third-year student at UCLA, double majoring in Computer Science and Clarinet Performance. 
Right now, I'm a Software Engineer Intern at Taiki Inc, where I'm working on a project to make tax documents easier to deal with using a universal API. 
Whether it's coding, solving problems, or playing the clarinet, I'm always up for a challenge and excited to keep learning.</p></div><div class="interests-section"><div class="interest coding"><h3>Coding</h3><p> I started coding in my sophomore year of high school, when I began development on a number of functional discord bots.
Although I initially started coding to find quick solutions to tedious tasks, I quickly realized that I had a passion for it,
and decided to pursue a career in software engineering. My first major project was a Discord bot called Neutra, which ultimately grew 
to provide data analytics for 500,000+ users. Encouraged by the success of Neutra, I began to explore other areas of software development,
such as web development, app creation, as well as other miscellaneous projects. </p></div><div class="interest music"><h3>Music</h3><p> Ever since I was a child, classical music has been a big part of my life. 
I've played the piano since I was 6 years old, and seriously considered 
pursuing a career as a pianist before realizing that the piano's soloistic nature did not 
align with my desire to collaborate with others. I still play the piano regularly, but after 
learning clarinet from my then-teacher Robert Zelickman, I decided to pursue a career in clarinet performance.
I currently study at UCLA under LA Phil principal clarinetist Boris Allakhverdyan, where half of my time is spent in 
a basement practice room searching for a good reed.</p></div><div class="interest games"><h3>Games</h3><p> After becoming fascinated with the appearance of chess pieces at the age of 5, I learned the basics from my father.
Several years later, fueled by my obsessive nature,
I would play 6+ hour matches, drill tactical puzzles, and read books on chess theory.
Although my goal is eventually to play competitively in tournaments, I recognize that I have bigger goals in other fields that take priority. 
Nevertheless, I play blitz games casually on chess.com, where I've reached a peak rating of 2450.
Recently, I've shifted my focus to other games, such as Backgammon, Poker, Guandan, and Sheng-Ji.</p></div><div class="interest sports"><h3>Sports</h3><p> Growing up, I played competitive tennis at my local clubs in San Diego. Although tennis was a passion of mine, I decided to quit in my junior year of high school
in order to prioritize my academics. About a year ago, after being introduced to Pickleball by my girlfriend's parents, I became obsessed 
with this social, yet strategic game. I frequent a local park where I find competitive games against ex-pro tennis
players who have converted to pickleball, and other equally competitive and like-minded people. I now play Pickleball on the UCLA club team, of which I was a founding member.</p></div></div></div><div class="spacer"></div></div></div><footer class="footer"> <div class="footer-section"> <a class="play-redirect" href="mailto:hecate946@gmail.com"> <img src="/assets/icons/contact.png" alt="Mail Icon" width="40px" height="40px"></a></div><div class="footer-section"> <span class="copywrite">&copy;</span>Cyrus Asasi 2024</div></footer><script src="/js/script.js"></script></body></html>
